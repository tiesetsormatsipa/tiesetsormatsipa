ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @tiesetso! Iâ€™m a passionate developer working on building unique, user-centric platforms that bridge freelancing and social media. Hereâ€™s a snapshot of my journey and what Iâ€™m up to:

ðŸ”¹ Platform Developer: I'm currently developing a hybrid freelancing platform that incorporates social features similar to Facebook. Iâ€™ve designed and implemented a variety of features, from secure login using email to an admin dashboard for insights. My work focuses on ensuring smooth client-freelancer interactions, with job posting, messaging, and comment functionality.

ðŸ”¹ Web Development Enthusiast: Skilled in HTML, CSS, Python (Flask), and MySQL, I enjoy building dynamic, responsive applications. Iâ€™ve developed numerous user interfaces with modern styling for an intuitive experience, including conversations, comment threads with timestamps, and flexible notification systems.

ðŸ”¹ Creative Coding with Arduino: Iâ€™m also an Arduino enthusiast! Iâ€™ve developed temperature and LED control systems using sensors (like the DHT11), LCD displays, and LEDs. My code integrates real-time data with Python for continuous plotting and interactive LED feedback based on temperature thresholds.

ðŸ”¹ Media Conversion Specialist: Leveraging moviepy in my Flask app, Iâ€™ve built features to extract audio from videos and remove audio from video files. I focus on optimizing processes for faster, more efficient conversions.

ðŸ”¹ Committed to Quality and Security: My web applications prioritize user security, with secure cookies, session management, and structured data handling. Iâ€™m also a fan of maintaining a clean, modular codebase, continuously working on performance improvements.

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack: My main stack includes Python, Flask, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Arduino, and libraries like LCD-I2C and DHT.

ðŸ“« Letâ€™s connect! Iâ€™m always open to collaboration, feedback, and exploring new tech ideas.
